<p>The actual strucutre is defined by however you create it (So zb-parent isn't necessarily the "parent"</p>
<p>I just decided to use zb as a prefix meaning zum beispeil (for example)
  I chose zb b/c ex could mean "ex" as in no longer used and ie could mean "Internet Explorer"
</p>
<p>Component naming seems to be &lt;Module> &lt;name with - instead of uppercase when using ng g c?> </p>
<app-zb-parent></app-zb-parent>
<router-outlet>
</router-outlet>
